# 🏡Predict Housing Prices💲 by Multivariable Regression using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, & Sci-kit Learn of Python

🌟Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you're working for a real estate development company.

🌟 We have built a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home's characteristics like:

❓The number of rooms

❓The distance to employment centres

❓How rich or poor the area is

❓How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

💪All of this is achieved using Mulivariable Regression.

👉We first use Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib & Seaborn to analyse the Housing data provided. 

👉Next, we use Plotly to create beautiful & interactive charts which can be used to design and think of possisible model characteristics.

👉Then, we set up the model using Sci-kit Learn library. We use the 80-20 rule to design and build our model where, 80% data is used as Training data & remaining 20% data is used for Testing the predictions made by the developed model.

👉Again we use Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly & Seaborn to visualize and compare the predicted values to the original expected values. This makes it easy to verify our models efficiency and performance.

🌟Thus Finally the Model is Tried and Tested and is ready to Make Proper Predictions of the House Prices with the appropriate data provided by the user.

👉From this we come to know:

✅How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's .pairplot().

✅How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.

✅How to run a multivariable regression.

✅How to evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.

✅How to analyse and look for patterns in a model's residuals.

✅How to improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.

✅How to specify your own values for various features and use your model to make a prediction.

🌟The Sample of the Notebook used for carrying out all of the above mentioned operations is given below
